# Hypothesis-Test-in-R-Shiny-WebApp
A shiny web-app about One Sample T-test.

<strong>What is the one-sample t-test?</strong>

The one-sample t-test is a statistical hypothesis test used to determine whether an unknown population mean is different from a specific value.
This test can use the test for continuous data.

The One Sample t Test can only compare a single sample mean to a specified constant. It can not compare sample means between two or more groups.

<strong> Hypotheses </strong>

The null hypothesis (H0) and (two-tailed) alternative hypothesis (H1) of the one sample T test can be expressed as:

H0: µ =  µ0  ("the population mean is equal to the [proposed] population mean")
H1: µ ≠  µ0  ("the population mean is not equal to the [proposed] population mean")

where µ is the "true" population mean and µ0 is the proposed value of the population mean.

It check whether it is one tail T-test by the confidence level.
